qm5 is a python library for dealing with the energy calculations of noble gases.


##Description
qm5 Simulates a cluster of Argon atoms using quantum mechanics (QM). The codes uses simple semiempirical quantum mechanics. Since Argon is a noble gas, mostly London dispersion forces predominate. The lowest energy dipole transition is from the occupied $3p$ states to the unoccupied 4s steate, including these 4 atomic orbitals per atom.  




## Installation

Use the conda manager

```bash
conda install qm5-molssi -c conda-forge
```

## Usage

```python
import qm5

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
